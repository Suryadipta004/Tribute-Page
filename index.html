                        In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers in the scientific journal Annalen der Physik, addressing the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc^2). This year is often referred to as his "Annus Mirabilis" (Miracle Year).

                <h2>Special Theory of Relativity (1905):</h2>
                <p> Einstein's groundbreaking theory introduced the concept that time and space are relative and interconnected, challenging classical physics. The famous equation E=mc² is a result of this theory, demonstrating the equivalence of mass and energy.</p>

                <p> Building upon his special theory, Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, which explained the gravitational force as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. This theory predicted the bending of light around massive objects and was later confirmed through observations.</p>

                <h2>Predicted Gravitational Waves (1916): </h2>

            <p>While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.<br>

                <br>sEinstein's right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California. Although the court initially held that the right had expired, that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right. Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.
                
                Mount Einstein in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named in 1955.<br><br>
                
                Mount Einstein in New Zealand's Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.</p>

            <p>Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities after the confirmation of his general theory of relativity in 1919. Although most of the public had little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and admired. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory". Eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else: "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."

                <br><br>Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".
                
                <br><br>Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him. For example, it is often claimed, erroneously, that he said, "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.</p>
